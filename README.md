ResqueUnit
==========

ResqueUnit provides some extra assertions and a mock Resque for
testing Rails code that depends on Resque. You can install it as
either a gem:

    gem install resque_unit

and in your test.rb: 

    config.gem 'resque_unit'

Examples
========

ResqueUnit provides some extra assertions for your unit tests. For
example, if you have code that queues a resque job:

    class MyJob
      @queue = :low  
    
      def self.perform(x)
        # do stuff
      end
    end
    
    def queue_job
      Resque.enqueue(MyJob, 1)
    end

You can write a unit test for code that queues this job:

    def test_job_queued
      queue_job
      assert_queued(MyJob) # assert that MyJob was queued in the :low queue
    end

You can also verify that a job was queued with arguments:

    def test_job_queued_with_arguments
      queue_job
      assert_queued(MyJob, [1])
    end

And you can run all the jobs in the queue, so you can verify that they
run correctly:

    def test_job_runs 
      queue_job 
      Resque.run!
      assert stuff_was_done, "Job didn't run"
    end

You can also access the queues directly:

    def test_jobs_in_queue
      queue_job 
      assert_equal 1, Resque.queue(:low).length
    end

Finally, you can enable hooks:

    Resque.enable_hooks!

    class MyJobWithHooks
      @queue = :hooked

      def self.perform(x)
        # do stuff
      end

      def self.after_enqueue_mark(*args)
        # called when the job is enqueued
      end

      def self.before_perform_mark(*args)
        # called just before the +perform+ method
      end

      def self.after_perform_mark(*args)
        # called just after the +perform+ method
      end

      def self.failure_perform_mark(*args)
        # called if the +perform+ method raised
      end

    end

    def queue_job
      Resque.enqueue(MyJobWithHooks, 1)
    end

Caveats
=======

* You should make sure that you call `Resque.reset!` in your test's
  setup method to clear all of the test queues.

Resque-Scheduler Support
========================

By calling `require 'resque_unit_scheduler'`, ResqueUnit will provide
mocks for [resque-scheduler's](http://github.com/bvandenbos/resque-scheduler)
`enqueue_at` and `enqueue_in` methods, along with a few extra
assertions. These are used like this:

    Resque.enqueue_in(600, MediumPriorityJob) # enqueues MediumPriorityJob in 600 seconds
    assert_queued_in(600, MediumPriorityJob) # will pass
    assert_not_queued_in(300, MediumPriorityJob) # will also pass

    Resque.enqueue_at(Time.now + 10, MediumPriorityJob) # enqueues MediumPriorityJob at 10 seconds from now
    assert_queued_at(Time.now + 10, MediumPriorityJob) # will pass
    assert_not_queued_at(Time.now + 1, MediumPriorityJob) # will also pass

For now, `assert_queued` and `assert_not_queued` will pass for any
scheduled job. `Resque.run!` will run all scheduled jobs as well.
